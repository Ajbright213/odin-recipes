            <h2>Description</h2>
        </div>

    <p>
        Carrot cake is thought to have originated in England where housewives used sweet products (e.g carrots) to naturally sweeten their confections during World War II. In 1943, the Ministry of Food published a short recipe for carrot cake

        Carrot cake's popularity increased in the 1980s due to consumer's perceived benefits of consuming vegetables with their highly caloric baked goods. Today, carrot cake is one of the most popular American desserts.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

       <ul>
            <div class="ingredients">
            <li>1½ tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons milk
            </li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely shredded carrot</li>
             </div>
            
       </ul>
    
            
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, or inside the mug, combine the melted butter, brown sugar, vanilla, milk, flour, baking powder, and cinnamon. Stir or whisk to combine the ingredients until smooth. Fold in the shredded carrots.</li>
            <li>Microwave the mug cake for 1 to 1½ minutes. In my microwave, it's best at 1 minute 15 seconds. Begin checking at 1 minute though. The cake should look set but be careful not to over-microwave.</li>
            <li>Let cool before topping with whipped cream, cream cheese glaze or simply powdered sugar</li>
            
    


        </ol>
